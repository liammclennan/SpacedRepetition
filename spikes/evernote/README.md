The apikey script is the consumer oauth version. Devtoken is for accessing my production account only.

Goal
----

To use evernote as a backing store, on account of it having some nice note-taking capabilities (audio,video,sketch).

Result
------

While evernote is nice it has significant drawbacks:

* closed, proprietary storage
* restricted api, jealously protected walled garden (they don't like you to read notes, just write them)
* no mathml support
* content is HTML, harder to work with than md
* limited wiki-style linking for building webs of notes
* API is shit

Therefore I have decided not to pursue this strategy.
